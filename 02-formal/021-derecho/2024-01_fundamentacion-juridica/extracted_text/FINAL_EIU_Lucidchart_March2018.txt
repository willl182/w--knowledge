Communication barriers in the modern workplaceIt wasn’t long ago that a work meeting meant 
gathering around a table to discuss an agenda. These days you may be using Slack, Hangouts or other digital collaboration platforms that blend messaging with video and allow real-time editing of documents. Even with these tools, communication 
at work can still break down, potentially 
endangering careers, creating stressful work environments and slowing growth. 
A survey from The Economist Intelligence Unit 
and sponsored by Lucidchart reveals some of the perceived causes and effects of these communication breakdowns. The survey, conducted from November 2017 to January 2018, included 403 senior executives, managers and junior staff at US companies divided equally and from companies with annual revenue of less than US$10m, between US$10m and US$1bn and more 
than US$1bn. The survey research provides 
insights about what employees see as the biggest barriers to workplace communication, the causes of the barriers and their impact on work life.  Complete survey results are included at the end of this report.Executive 
summary

Communication barriers in the modern workplaceKey highlights
l Poor communication is having a tremendous 
impact on the workplace. Unclear instructions 
from superiors, pointless meetings and other stressors can snowball into larger issues with widespread impacts on the business. Respondents say communication barriers are leading to a delay 
or failure to complete projects (44%), low morale 
(31%), missed performance goals (25%) and even lost sales (18%)—some worth hundreds of thousands of dollars.
l The most frequently cited cause of 
communication barriers is fundamentally human: different communication styles. In an age of constantly changing and real-time communication tools, this barrier is made more complex by generational and functional differences 
in communication preferences.
l The use of instant messaging and social 
media at work reflects a gap between how 
generations use certain communication tools. Nearly a third of millennials (31%) say they use instant messaging at work every day, compared with only 12% of baby boomers. Tomorrow’s 
executives will find they have to adapt if they want 
to be effective today when working with older generations that prefer to pick up a phone. At the same time, older generations would be wise to embrace the new communication tools on which developing leaders will continue to rely.l There is a discrepancy between the 
communication tools that people find most effective and the ones they regularly use. 
Visual-based tools, for example, are relatively underused compared with their effectiveness. Video conferencing, presentation decks, white 
boards and sketch pads are largely seen as 
somewhat or very effective at helping respondents share ideas and understand them well. However, email, which is the most commonly used method of workplace communication, is not considered very effective by the majority of respondents. 
l An employee’s place in the pecking order 
affects the fallout they face from poor communication. Middle managers tend to be affected the most by communication barriers. For example, nearly half of directors (49%) say their colleagues experience the consequences of poor 
communication either frequently or very 
frequently—more than C-level executives and non-manager employees. This fact though is not so surprising considering they are constantly conveying information back and forth between senior executives and junior employees, both of whom have different approaches to communication.

Communication barriers in the modern workplaceThe impact of poor 
communication
The repercussions of poor communication in the 
workplace can be severe and widespread: 44% of respondents indicate that miscommunication has caused a delay or failure to complete projects. As for the direct impact on business, 18% say miscommunication has led to the loss of a sale, 
nearly a third (30%) of which were valued between 
US$100,000 and US$999,999.
Communication breakdowns also contribute to less tangible issues, such as stress (52%) and low morale (31%). Employees of all ages and seniority levels must consider a number of factors in order to improve workplace communication and, as a result, productivity, morale and the bottom line.
Causes of poor 
communication
Different communication styles (42%), unclear 
responsibilities (34%) and time pressures (31%) are the three most frequently cited causes of poor communication. These causes suggest that managers need to tailor their communication styles to those around them to be effective. Doing so 
would ensure team members operate with a clear 
understanding of what they need to accomplish 
and expectations of when goals should be met.  Ill communication

Communication barriers in the modern workplace“We need to be more mindful in general about 
what format people use to get together and 
communicate,” says Susan Cain, author of Quiet: The power of introverts in a world that can’t stop talking. Ms Cain says we have nearly constant communication happening. However, because we 
aren’t always mindful about the mode of 
communication we use, people are often left unclear about responsibilities or unable to contribute meaningfully to the discussion.
Overcoming communication barriers will 
ultimately have to involve not only accommodating different personal styles, but also ensuring that management’s communications are effective and 
account for generational differences in how 
information is shared at work.
Different communication styles and ineffective 
use of communication tools are contributing to the lack of clarity about responsibilities that is evident in the research, and certainly adding to workplace stress levels. In fact, the survey shows that unclear instructions from a senior colleague or manager is the most frequently cited stressful situation at work.
A third of millennials (33%), who are defined as being born between 1981 and 1999, call themselves functional communicators. That is far more than members of Generation X (15%), born 1965-1980, or baby boomers (21%), born 1964 or earlier. Baby boomers and members of Generation X described themselves as personal communicators (34% and 
39%, respectively) more often than millennials 
(23%). 
Generation gaps
Different generations do agree on something. Sixty-five per cent of respondents say that face-to-face meetings are a very effective mode of communication—and this number does not vary significantly among generations. Yet only 22% say they have these meetings every day. “We are best at face-to-face communication in small groups in real time,” says Art Markman, professor of psychology and marketing at the University of Texas at Austin. “Yet globalisation and flexible work 
schedules are distributing people in time, narrowing 
the window when people’s availability overlaps and they could meet in person. I don’t see that going away,” he adds.  
Indeed, only 28% of respondents say in the past 
year they have not worked remotely. This suggests modern-day employees will need to use a range of other modes of communication more effectively—including real-time collaboration tools such as video chat and instant messaging—and many already are.
Usage of social media and instant messaging at 
work is driving the biggest wedge in communication between millennials and older colleagues. Nearly a third of millennials (31%) and members of Generation X (30%) say they have used instant messaging every day in the past year to communicate with colleagues and clients. However, only 12% of baby boomers say the same. A third of boomers (34%) say they have not used instant 
messaging in the past year.

Communication barriers in the modern workplaceMr Markman says millennials who wish to rise to 
leadership positions need to master the ability to 
communicate clearly in person so that they can reach these older generations. “We have a generation who is not as practiced at engaging in real time with people,” he explains. 
Future leaders must have the ability to 
communicate across styles and modes, reaching across generations. As functional communicators, millennials will probably continue to use various new tools as they ascend and grow older. The trick will be to tailor each one’s use to the different communication styles around them. Likewise, older generations should be willing to embrace new communication tools that developing leaders are using to connect and innovate.Seeing is believing
Some interesting discrepancies exist between which modes of communication are seen as effective and which are frequently used. Email is unsurprisingly the most heavily used mode of communication, with 60% of respondents saying they use it every day. Yet only 40% say it is a very 
effective means of communication.
But what if heavily used modes of 
communication, such as email and phones, were 
used in tandem with other tools that are viewed as relatively more effective? For example, many respondents say visual-based tools are effective; they just don’t use them often. Although 55% say video conferencing is somewhat or very effective, only 7% use it daily. Similarly, 60% see presentation decks and 50% see white boards and sketch pads as somewhat or very effective, but only 9% in both cases use them daily. Rather than replacing 
communication tools, improving daily 
communication at work may be more about using effective technologies more often.Modes of communication

Communication barriers in the modern workplaceThe corporate totem 
pole
Corporate roles can also contribute to poor 
communication at work. Directors and middle managers in particular tend to get caught in the middle of those conflicting communication preferences. As a result, they are affected by miscommunication most frequently: 49% of 
directors say the consequences of poor 
communication occur frequently or very frequently among their colleagues. That is substantially more than the 28% of C-suite executives who say the same.
“Middle managers have the worst of all worlds,” 
Mr Markman says. “Communication is one of the most significant parts of their job because they’re dealing with the widest variety of people.”
Probably because of their location in the hierarchy, directors tend to be prolific users of nearly every tool and mode of communication—much more so than other seniorities. Furthermore, a larger share of directors finds nearly every mode of communication more effective than their colleagues of different seniorities. They are the Swiss Army knife equivalent of corporate internal communication. 
Ms Cain believes there are perks to this. “The 
great value of being stuck in the middle is you can 
easily empathise with those above and below you 
because you’re simultaneously in both roles,” she says. “You have tremendous insight into what everyone around you is feeling, you can project yourself into their shoes and you know what the pressures and stressors are for your boss.”
As individuals move up the corporate ladder, 
they need to not just have a broad understanding of different communication styles but also adapt their approach to their position in the organisation.

Communication barriers in the modern workplaceWhat to do about 
workplace miscommunication?
Work environments don’t have to be full of 
miscommunication land mines, and businesses can take practical steps to improve communication. Meetings are a good place to start. The survey shows that 78% of respondents think having clearer goals for every scheduled meeting would have a 
significant impact on improving workplace communication, including 39% who say the 
improvement would be very significant. Moreover, six out of ten respondents say firm-wide training (62%) and having a wider range of communication 
tools to use (63%) would significantly improve work 
communication. By improving in areas such as these, as well as being aware of communication differences and the best applications of various tools, the workforce can both communicate more effectively and keep pace with the inevitable continuous change in when and how we connect at work.
