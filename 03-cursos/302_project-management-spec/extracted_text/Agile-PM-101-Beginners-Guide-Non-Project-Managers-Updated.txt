Often the people managing the work are simply ‘winging it’, 
which can result in a struggle to manage multiple projects, 
meet deadlines, and adapt to changing requirements. 
Studies have found  that companies who use a standard 
project management methodology have had “fewer than half 
as many project failures than those that did not have one.” With 
this in mind, anyone who manages work should consider 
adopting a standard project management method. But with all 
the PM methods  out there, how are you to know which one is 
best for your work management needs?
In this e-book, we’ll take a look at the Agile project management 
philosophy. We’ll give an overview of the top Agile methods, 
provide the advantages and disadvantages of each, and tell you 
how you can get started implementing Agile practices to 
ensure your next project is a success.Everyone 
manages  
projects
whether they’re a certified 
project manager or not.

Agile Project Management 101

Agile refers to any process that aligns with the concepts of the 
Agile Manifesto. In 2001, 17 software developers met to discuss 
lightweight development methods. They published the 
Manifesto for Agile Software Development , which covered 
how they found “better ways of developing software by doing it 
and helping others do it.”Agile 
Overview
Agile project management is 
based on an incremental, 
iterative approach
Instead of in-depth planning at the 
beginning of the project, Agile 
methodologies are open to changing 
requirements over time and 
encourages constant feedback from 
the end users. The goal of each 
iteration is to produce a working 
product.Requirements

12 Agile PrinciplesThe Agile Manifesto lists 12 principles to 
guide teams on how to execute with agility:
1 2Satisfy the 
customer 
Our highest priority is to 
satisfy the customer 
through early and 
continuous delivery of 
valuable software.Welcome  
changing 
requirements
Even late in development.  
Agile processes harness  
change for the customer’s 
competitive advantage.Deliver working 
software 
frequently
from a couple of weeks to a 
couple of months, with 
preference to the shorter 
timescale.3
4 5Work  
together 
Business people and 
developers must work 
together daily throughout 
the project.Build projects 
around motivated 
individuals 
Give them the environment and 
support they need, and trust 
them to get the job done.Face-to-face 
conversation 
The most efficient and 
effective method of 
conveying information to and 
within a development team is 
face-to-face conversation.6

7 8Focus on 
working 
software 
Working software is the 
primary measure of progress.Promote 
sustainable 
development 
Agile processes promote 
sustainable development. The 
sponsors, developers, and users 
should be able to maintain a 
constant pace indefinitely.Ensure  
technical 
excellence 
Continuous attention to 
technical excellence and good 
design enhances agility.9
10 11Simplicity 
The art of maximizing the 
amount of work not done 
– is essential.Self-organizing 
teams 
The best architectures, 
requirements, and designs 
emerge from self-organizing 
teams.Reflect and  
adjustment
At regular intervals, the team 
reflects on how to become 
more effective, then tunes 
and adjusts its behavior 
accordingly.12

Agile Development Cycle
The phases in the Agile development cycle may not happen in succession; they are flexible and always evolving, 
with many happening in parallel.
Planning
Once an idea is deemed viable, the project team comes 
together to identify features, prioritize each feature, and 
assign them to an iteration.
Requirements analysis
Key stakeholders and users meet to identify business 
requirements that are quantifiable, relevant, and detailed.
Design
The design is prepared from the requirements identified 
and the team considers what the product or solution will 
look like, deciding on a test strategy or plan to proceed.Implementation, coding, development
Coding or developing features, scheduling iterations  
for deployment.
Testing
Test the code against the requirements to make sure the product 
is actually solving customer needs. This phase includes unit 
testing, integration testing, system testing, and acceptance testing.
Deployment
Deliver the product to customers. Once customers start using the 
product, they may run into new problems that the project team will 
need to address in future iterations.
5
Agile Project Management 101

Advantages of Agile
Agile evolved from different development approaches in the 1990s and is a response to some project managers’ 
dislike of the rigid, linear Waterfall methodology. It focuses on flexibility, continuous improvement, and speed.
+ Change is embraced
 With shorter planning cycles, there’s always opportunity 
to refine and reprioritize the backlog to accommodate 
changes throughout the project.
+ End-goal can be unknown
 Agile is beneficial for projects where the end-goal is not 
clearly defined. As the project progresses, the goals will 
become evident and the team can adapt.
+ Faster, high-quality delivery
 Breaking down the project into iterations allows the team 
to focus on high-quality development, testing, and 
collaboration. Conducting testing during each iteration 
means that bugs get identified and solved more quickly.+ Strong team interaction
 Agile embraces frequent communication and face-to-
face interactions.
+ Customers are heard
 Customers have many opportunities to see the work 
being delivered, share their input, and have an impact 
on the end product.
+ Continuous improvement
 Feedback is encouraged from users and team 
members throughout the project, so lessons learned 
are used to improve future iterations.

Agile Project Management 101

Disadvantages of Agile
While flexibility in Agile is usually a positive, it also comes with some trade-offs. It can be hard to establish a solid 
delivery date, documentation can be neglected, or the final product can be very different than originally intended.
– Planning can be less concrete
 Because project managers are often reprioritizing 
tasks, it’s possible some items scheduled for delivery 
may not be complete in time. And, additional sprints 
may be added at any time in the project, adding to the 
overall timeline.
– Team must be knowledgeable
 Agile teams are usually small, so team members must 
be highly skilled in a variety of areas and understand 
Agile methodology.– Time commitment from 
developers is required
 Active involvement and collaboration is required 
throughout the Agile process, which is more time 
consuming than a traditional approach.
– Documentation can be neglected
 Agile prefers working deliverables over comprehensive 
documentation. While documentation on its own does 
not lead to success, teams should find the right 
balance between documentation and discussion.

KanbanTop 
Methodologies 
Used to 
Implement 
Agile
There are a number of specific methods 
within the Agile movement. We’ll take an 
in-depth look at two of the top Agile 
Methodologies: Scrum and Kanban.Scrum
8
Agile Project Management 101

Scrum 
Methodology
Scrum is a subset of Agile and one of 
the most popular process 
frameworks for implementing Agile. 
It is an iterative development model often used to 
manage complex software and product 
development. Fixed-length iterations, called sprints 
lasting one to two weeks long, allow the team to 
ship software on a regular cadence. At the end of 
each sprint, stakeholders and team members meet 
to plan next steps.
9
Agile Project Management 101

Advantages of Scrum
Scrum is a highly prescriptive framework with specific roles and ceremonies. While it can be a lot to learn,  
these rules have multiple advantages:
+ More transparency and  
project visibility
 With daily stand-up meetings, the whole team knows 
who is doing what and issues are identified in advance, 
improving communication and enabling the team to take 
care of issues right away.
+ Increased team accountability
 There is no project manager. Instead, the team 
collectively decides what work they can complete in 
each sprint, working together collaboratively, with 
accountability.+ Easy to accommodate changes
 With short sprints and constant feedback, it’s easier to 
accommodate changes.
+ Increased cost savings
 Constant communication ensures the team is aware of 
all issues and changes sooner, helping to lower 
expenses and increase quality.
10
Agile Project Management 101

Disadvantages of Scrum
While Scrum offers some concrete benefits, it also has some downsides. Scrum requires a high level of experience 
and commitment from the team and projects can be at risk of scope creep:
– Risk of scope creep
 Some Scrum projects can experience scope creep due 
to a lack of a specific end date, tempting stakeholders to 
keep requesting additional functionality.
– Team requires experience  
and commitment
 The team needs to be familiar with Scrum principles to 
succeed, as well as needs to commit to the daily 
meetings and stay on the team for the entire project.– The wrong Scrum Master can ruin 
everything
 The Scrum Master is very different from a project 
manager. The Scrum Master does not have authority 
over the team, so he or she must trust the team to 
complete the work.
– Poorly defined tasks can lead  
to inaccuracies
 Project costs and timelines won’t be accurate if tasks 
are not well defined. If the initial goals are unclear, 
planning becomes difficult and sprints can take more 
time than originally estimated.
11
Agile Project Management 101

Roles in Scrum
Product 
Owner
The Scrum Product Owner has 
the vision of what to build and 
conveys that to the team. He or 
she focuses on business and 
market requirements, prioritizing 
the work that needs to be done, 
managing the backlog, providing 
guidance on which features to 
ship next, and interacting with the 
team and other stakeholders to 
make sure everyone understands 
the items on the product backlog.Scrum 
Master
Often considered the coach for 
the team, the Scrum Master helps 
the team do their best possible 
work. This means organizing 
meetings, dealing with roadblocks 
and challenges, and working with 
the Product Owner to ensure the 
product backlog is ready for the 
next sprint.Scrum  
Team
The Scrum Team is comprised of 
five to seven members. Unlike 
traditional development teams, 
there are not distinct roles like 
programmer, designer, or tester. 
Everyone on the project completes 
the set of work together.
12
Agile Project Management 101

4Daily Scrum 
meetings
The Daily Scrum is a 15-minute stand-
up meeting that happens at the same 
time and place every day during the 
sprint. During the meeting each team 
member talks about what they 
worked on the day before, what they’ll 
work on today, and any roadblocks.5Sprint review 
meeting
At the end of each sprint, the team 
presents the work they have 
completed as a live demo rather 
than a presentation.6Sprint  
retrospective 
meeting
Also at the end of each sprint, the team 
reflects on how well Scrum is working 
for them and talks about any changes 
that need to be made in the next sprint.1Product backlog
The product backlog is not a list of 
things to be completed, but rather it 
is a list of all the desired features for 
the product.2Sprint planning
Before each sprint, the Product Owner 
presents the top items on the backlog 
in a sprint planning meeting. The 
team determines the work they can 
complete during the sprint and moves 
the work from the product backlog to 
the sprint backlog.3Backlog 
refinement/
grooming
The product backlog is not a list of 
things to be completed, but rather it 
is a list of all the desired features for 
the product.Steps in the Scrum Process

Agile Project Management 101

Tools and Artifacts in Scrum
In addition to roles and ceremonies, Scrum projects also include certain tools and “artifacts”. For example, the team 
uses a Scrum board to visualize the backlog or a burndown chart to show outstanding work. The most common are: 
Scrum board
The Scrum board helps 
to visualize your sprint 
backlog and traditionally 
involves index cards or 
Post-It notes on a 
whiteboard. The board is 
usually divided into three 
categories: to do, work in 
progress, and done. The 
team updates the board 
by moving tasks (written 
on cards) through the 
columns on the board.User stories
A user story describes a 
software feature from the 
customer’s perspective. It 
includes the type of user, 
what they want, and why 
they want it.Burndown 
chart
A burndown chart 
represents all 
outstanding work. The 
backlog is usually on the 
vertical axis, with time 
along the horizontal axis. 
A burndown chart can 
warn the team of 
potential risk and helps to 
show the impact of 
decisions.Timeboxing
A timebox is a set period 
of time that a team works 
towards completing a 
goal. Instead of letting a 
team work until the goal 
is reached, the timebox 
approach stops work 
when the time limit is 
reached.Icebox
Any user stories that are 
recorded but not moved 
to development are 
stored in the icebox.

Agile Project Management 101

Kanban 
Methodology
Kanban is Japanese for “visual sign” 
or “card.” It is a visual framework 
used to implement Agile and shows 
what to produce, when to produce it, 
and how much to produce. It 
encourages small, incremental 
changes to your current system and 
does not require a certain set up or 
procedure (meaning, you could 
overlay Kanban on top of other 
existing workflows).Kanban was inspired by the Toyota 
Production System and Lean Manufacturing. 
In the 1940s, Toyota improved its engineering 
process by modeling it after how 
supermarkets stock shelves. Engineer Taiichi 
Ohno noticed that supermarkets stock just 
enough product to meet demand. Inventory 
would only be restocked when there was 
empty space on the shelf (a visual cue).
These same ideas apply to software teams 
and IT projects today. In this context, 
development work-in-progress (WIP) takes 
the place of inventory, and new work can only 
be added when there is an “empty space” on 
the team’s visual Kanban board. Kanban 
matches the amount of WIP to the team’s 
capacity, improving flexibility, transparency, 
and output.
15
Agile Project Management 101

A Kanban board, whether it is physical or online, is made up of 
different swim lanes or columns. The simplest boards have 
three columns: to do, in progress, and done. Other projects may 
consist of backlog, ready, coding, testing, approval, and done 
columns.
Kanban cards (like sticky notes) represent the work and each 
card is placed on the board in the lane that represents the status 
of that work. These cards communicate status at a glance. You 
could also use different color cards to represent different details. 
For example, green cards could represent a feature and orange 
cards could represent a task.About the 
Kanban 
Board
A Kanban board is a tool to 
implement the Kanban method 
for projects. 
Traditionally, this tool has been a 
physical board, with magnets, plastic 
chips, or sticky notes on a whiteboard. 
However, in recent years, more and 
more project management software 
tools have created online Kanban 
boards.
16
Agile Project Management 101

Advantages of Kanban
Kanban’s visual nature offers a unique advantage when implementing Agile. The Kanban board is easy to learn and 
understand, it improves flow of work, and minimizes cycle time:
+ Increases flexibility
 Kanban is an evolving, fluid model. There are no set 
phase durations and priorities are reevaluated with new 
information.
+ Reduces waste
 Kanban revolves around reducing waste, ensuring that 
teams don’t spend time doing work that isn’t needed or 
doing the wrong kind of work.
+ Easy to understand
 The visual nature of Kanban helps to make it intuitive 
and easy to learn.+ Improves delivery flow
 Kanban focuses on the just-in-time delivery of value 
and delivering work to customers on a regular 
cadence.
+ Minimizes cycle time
 Cycle time is the amount of time it takes for work to 
move through the team’s workflow. In Kanban projects, 
the entire team helps to ensure the work is moving 
quickly and successfully through the process.
17
Agile Project Management 101

Disadvantages of Kanban
Many of the disadvantages associated with Kanban come with misuse or mishandling of the Kanban board.  
An outdated or overcomplicated board can lead to confusion, inaccuracies, or miscommunication:
– Outdated board can lead to issues
 The team must be committed to keeping the Kanban 
board up to date, otherwise they’ll be working off 
inaccurate information.
– Teams can overcomplicate  
the board
 The Kanban board should remain clear and easy to read. 
Adding bells and whistles to the Kanban board just 
buries the important information.
– Lack of timing
 The columns on the Kanban board are marked by phase, 
with no timeframes associated.
18
Agile Project Management 101

Core Practices and  
Principles of KanbanEvery Kanban project should 
follow these core principles:
Visualize the 
workflow
A visual representation of 
your work allows you to 
understand the big 
picture and see how the 
flow of work progresses. 
By making all the work 
visible you can identify 
issues early on and 
improve collaboration.Limit work 
in progress 
(WIP)
Work in progress limits 
determine the minimum 
and maximum amount of 
work for each column on 
the board or for each 
workflow. By putting a 
limit on WIP, you can 
increase speed and 
flexibility, and reduce the 
need for prioritizing tasks.Manage and 
enhance 
the flow
The flow of work 
throughout the Kanban 
board should be 
monitored for possible 
improvements. A fast, 
smooth flow shows the 
team is creating value 
quickly.Make 
process 
policies 
explicit
Everyone needs to 
understand how things 
work or what qualifies as 
“done”. Modify the board 
to make these processes 
more clear.Continuously 
improve
The Kanban method 
encourages small, 
continuous changes that 
stick. Once the Kanban 
system is in place, the 
team will be able to 
identify and understand 
issues and suggest 
improvements.
19
Agile Project Management 101

Other Agile Methodologies
Extreme  
Programming (XP)
This type of software development is 
intended to improve quality and 
responsiveness to evolving customer 
requirements.Feature-driven 
development (FDD)
There are five basic activities in FDD: 
develop overall model, build feature list, 
plan by feature, design by feature, and 
build by feature.Adaptive system 
development (ASD)
ASD represents the idea that projects 
should always be in a state of continuous 
adaptation, and has a cycle of three 
repeating series: speculate, collaborate, 
and learn.
Dynamic Systems 
Development Method (DSDM)
DSDM addresses the common failures of IT 
projects. The eight principles of DSDM are: 
focus on the business need, deliver on time, 
collaborate, never compromise quality, build 
incrementally from firm foundations, develop 
iteratively, communicate continuously and 
clearly, and demonstrate control.Lean Software 
Development (LSD)
LSD can be characterized by seven 
principles: eliminate waste, amplify 
learning, decide as late as possible, 
deliver as fast as possible, empower the 
team, build integrity in, and see the whole.Crystal Clear
This methodology can be used with teams of 
six to eight developers and it focuses on the 
people, not processes or artifacts. Crystal 
Clear requires the following: frequent delivery 
of usable code to users, reflective 
improvement, and osmotic communication 
preferably by being co-located.

How to  
Get Started 
with Agile
Getting started with Agile can be 
easy. We’ll take a look at a few 
ways to implement Agile 
practices and how to pick the 
right Agile tool.
21
Agile Project Management 101

Whichever route you choose, 
remember that Agile is flexible 
in its very nature. There is no 
wrong or right way to get 
started with Agile.3 Ways to Implement 
Agile Practices
Stand up 
Meetings
A simple way to get started with Agile is 
to incorporate daily stand-up meetings 
into your project. Daily stand-up 
meetings are easy to incorporate into 
any project methodology you already 
use (even Waterfall) and don’t require 
any training or knowledge transfer.Kanban 
Board
Another way to incorporate Agile 
practices is to create and use a Kanban 
board. The Kanban board is simple tool 
to help your team visualize the flow of 
work as it’s getting done. Use the board 
during stand-up meetings to discuss 
current work in progress or display it 
where your team can easily access it to 
make updates to task status.Changing 
Team Roles
Some methods of Agile may result in the 
need to change team roles. For example, 
working with Scrum, the team may need 
to take more responsibility and boost 
speed of delivery. A good place to start 
with Scrum is to talk about the roles and 
responsibilities. Every project must have 
a Scrum Master, Product Owner, and 
Scrum Team. Clarifying these roles will 
help teams understand their 
responsibilities and remain accountable.
22
Agile Project Management 101

Finding the  
Best Agile ToolIf you’re considering a switch to Agile project 
management, you should determine which tool is 
best to help track and manage your projects. Here 
are the top things to consider when choosing a tool:
Familiar and 
Easy to Use
When switching to a new 
tool, familiarity is key. You 
don’t want your team 
spending valuable time 
learning a new program. 
Agile project management 
software should be flexible 
and intuitive to use.Collaboration & 
Communication
Find a tool that facilitates 
collaboration between 
internal and external 
stakeholders. Cloud tools 
enable people to work in 
real-time, view and edit 
projects from anywhere, 
stay up to date on current 
status, and communicate 
with others viewing the 
project.Searchable, 
Central 
Storage
It’s increasingly important 
to use cloud storage 
services like Dropbox, 
Google Drive, Box, or 
OneDrive for project 
documentation storage. 
Whatever service you 
use, make sure your Agile 
tool can seamlessly 
connect with them to 
store vital assets.Mobile  
Ready
The modern worker relies 
on their smartphone, 
tablet and other mobile 
devices to get work done. 
And many workers want to 
access parts of their 
project management 
software while they are on 
the go. Be sure to evaluate 
all the mobile options a 
tool has to offer.Work 
Visualization
Today, work design is 
infinitely different. The 
“one-size-fits-all” approach 
to project management no 
longer works. Find a tool 
that includes multiple 
ways to visualize and 
manage your work - 
whether it be waterfall or 
agile - with Gantt charts, 
spreadsheet, kanban 
boards, calendars, reports, 
and dashboards.
23
Agile Project Management 101

With fewer than one-third of all projects completed on 
time and on budget, it can sometimes seem 
impossible to lead new projects to success. 
That’s why finding the best project management 
method is important to the success of your projects. 
Whether you decide to go with Agile, Scrum, Kanban, 
or even a hybrid of multiple methods, deciding on a 
standard way to manage projects will help to 
streamline the process, increase team output, and 
keep projects on track.
Plus, once you’ve picked the best method for your 
team, finding the right agile project management tool 
can help implement and track the process and ensure 
no detail is missed.A More
