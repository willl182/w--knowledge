## Module 3: Building Bash Scripts
Objective: Learn to write complex Bash scripts with logic and control flow to automate repetitive tasks and build command-line tools for data engineering.

**Topics Covered:**

Shell Logic and Control Flow (e.g., if, for, while statements)
Data Manipulation and Filtering in Bash
Command-Line Tool Creation in Bash
Introduction to Bash Functions, Makefiles, and Dockerfiles

**Learning Activities:**

Videos: Building Bash scripts, using loops and control flow, data manipulation
Readings: Key terms, script-building techniques, reflections
Assignments: Quizzes on control flow, data manipulation, and command-line tools
Labs: Writing loops in Bash, truncating data files, building a data-processing CLI, working with functions
Total Time Commitment: ~19 hours

## Module 4: Composing File and Data Solutions
Objective: Apply advanced Linux techniques to manage files, directories, permissions, and text-based data for data engineering solutions.

**Topics Covered:**

File and Directory Management (e.g., find, locate, chmod, chown)
Searching and Modifying Filesystem Content
Data Processing Commands (grep, cut, sort, uniq)
Text Manipulation with awk, sed, and regex

**Learning Activities:**

Videos: Filesystem searching, modifying files and permissions, text processing
Readings: Key terms, reflections on file management and text processing
Assignments: Quizzes on filesystem searches, permissions, and text processing
Labs: Search commands in Bash, practicing shell permissions, advanced text searching, and a final phrase-repeating challenge.
Total Time Commitment: ~19 hours

## Summary
The course introduces key concepts essential for Bash CLI proficiency, including the efficiency of command-line interface (CLI) use, scripting basics, configuration files, environment variables, and search tools. For data scientists, engineers, and machine learning practitioners, Bash provides a fast and efficient way to execute commands and automate tasks.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Bash CLI (Command Line Interface)

Bash CLI offers a direct, efficient path for executing commands, critical for data and machine learning engineers needing quick access to system resources.
Importance: It minimizes time to task completion, allowing direct execution of operations without the overhead of graphical interfaces.

### 2. Scripting Basics
Shebang Line: A special line in scripts (e.g., `#!/bin/bash`) that specifies the interpreter, ensuring that the correct programming language executes the code.
Example: `#!/usr/bin/env python3` would run the script in Python.
Chmod: This command (`chmod +x`) changes file permissions to make scripts executable.
Example: `chmod +x script.sh` allows the script to be run by typing `./script.sh`.

### 3. Configuration Files and Variables
`.bashrc` File: Runs every time a new terminal session is opened, allowing customization of the terminal environment with commands, aliases, and variable definitions.
Example: An alias (`alias mycmd='cd /project/dir && source env/bin/activate'`) can simplify repetitive tasks.
Environment Variables: Store sensitive information (e.g., API keys) in `.bashrc` to prevent accidental exposure in version control.
`.profile` File: Executes only upon login, suitable for initial setups that donâ€™t need to run in every new session.

### 4. Search Utilities
`find`: Performs real-time, exhaustive searches by scanning the entire filesystem based on user-defined patterns.
Example: `find . -name "*.txt"` locates all .txt files in the current directory and subdirectories.
`locate`: Uses a pre-built index for faster, metadata-based searches, ideal for large filesystems where find would be slower.
Trade-off: `find` offers thorough searches; `locate` provides speed.

### Summary of Key Points
Efficiency: Bash CLI minimizes task completion time.
Customization: `.bashrc` and `.profile` enhance the terminal environment.
Search Flexibility: Use `find` for thoroughness and `locate` for speed.
