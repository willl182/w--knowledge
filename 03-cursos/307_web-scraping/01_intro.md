### What is programming?

[[programming]] [[script]] [[program]]

- **Programming**: A program is a set of instructions that tells a computer how to complete a task. The program is written in a **programming language**, which has its own **syntax** (rules for constructing statements) and **semantics** (the meaning behind those statements).

- **Syntax and Semantics**: 
  - **Syntax**: The structure or rules for how statements are formed (like grammar in human languages).
  - **Semantics**: The meaning or effect of those statements in the program (similar to the meaning of sentences in human languages).

- **Programming Languages**: Just as there are many spoken languages, there are many programming languages, each with its own features and use cases. Understanding one programming language makes learning others easier, as they share fundamental concepts.

- **Clarity in Programming**: Computers follow instructions exactly as written, so it's important to be precise and clear when writing a program to avoid errors.

- **Script vs Program**: 
  - **Script**: A type of program that is short, simple, and can be written and deployed quickly. In this course, "script" and "program" are used interchangeably.

- **Python**: The course focuses on Python, a scripting language, to teach programming fundamentals, including syntax and semantics. Python's simplicity and versatility make it ideal for beginners.

>**Question: Why do we need to learn the syntax and semantics of a programming language?**

To allow us to clearly express what we want the computer to do.
Learning the syntax (rules for constructing instructions) and semantics (the meaning behind the instructions) of a programming language is essential to communicate with the computer effectively and ensure it performs the tasks correctly.

### What is automation

[[automation]]

**Automation** is the process of replacing manual tasks with ones that occur automatically. It enhances efficiency by reducing human intervention and increasing consistency. Examples of automation include scheduled bill payments, self-checkout systems, and traffic lights, which regulate traffic without human input, ensuring tasks are performed reliably without error.

Key benefits of automation include:

- **Consistency**: Machines don’t get tired or make mistakes, unlike humans.
- **Time-saving**: Automation can handle repetitive tasks, freeing up time for more complex or creative work.
- **Error reduction**: Automated processes are less prone to human errors.

However, **automation is not suitable for every task**. Some tasks require creativity, flexibility, or complex decision-making, such as a hairdresser cutting hair, where automation may not be practical or cost-effective.

In summary, **automation** is a valuable tool when applied to repetitive, rule-based tasks that benefit from consistency and reliability. It is essential to know when and where automation can be effectively used.

>**Question What’s automation?**

The process of replacing a manual step with one that happens automatically.

### Uses for automation

**Automation** is the process of replacing repetitive manual tasks with automated ones, reducing human errors, increasing consistency, and saving time. Automation ensures that tasks are performed exactly as instructed, consistently, and without fatigue. It can be more cost-effective than using human labor for certain tasks. 

**Appropriate uses for automation** include:
- Regulating traffic lights
- Automating repetitive tasks prone to human error
- Sending personalized emails
- Detecting and removing duplicate data
- Installing software and generating reports
- Deploying programs across networks

**Automation is not suitable** for tasks requiring human creativity, complex evaluation, or tasks involving psychology, social connection, or physical limitations, such as:
- Designing creative work (e.g., webpages, photography)
- Troubleshooting complex problems
- Tasks that involve human interaction, like customer service or hiring

**Artificial Intelligence (AI)** is different from basic automation. While automation follows explicit instructions, AI uses machine learning to perform complex tasks and learn new ones without requiring explicit programming for every task. AI is a more advanced form of automation.

**Automation** in IT is about using computers to perform repetitive tasks efficiently. It is particularly effective for tasks that need to be done frequently with little variation, as it reduces human error and saves time.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Automating Repetitive Tasks**: For example, using scripts to automate login credentials, eliminating the need to type commands manually each day.
- **Reducing Errors and Time**: Automation prevents mistakes in repetitive tasks like managing email lists, where a program can ensure no duplicates and add new emails without manual oversight.
- **Reusability**: Once a program or script is written, it can be used repeatedly for similar tasks, saving more time in the future.
- **Personalization**: Automation can also be used to personalize tasks (like emails), by dynamically inserting individual names and details, making processes more efficient without requiring manual effort.
- **Focus on More Valuable Tasks**: Automating mundane tasks allows individuals to dedicate time to more complex and important projects.

Learning how to program is the first step in enabling automation, allowing you to delegate repetitive tasks to computers and increase productivity.

## Introduction to python

### What is Python

[[python]] [[programming-language]] [[python-interpreter]]

**Python** is a popular programming language known for its readability and simplicity, making it ideal for beginners. It is often likened to human language due to its straightforward syntax, which makes writing and understanding code easier. Python allows users to express tasks in a clear, readable way. For example, a simple Python code snippet can define a list of names and generate a greeting for each name.

In this course, Python will be used to demonstrate basic programming concepts and how to write scripts. You'll start with small coding exercises and gradually work up to more complex tasks. To practice, you can use online Python interpreters, which read and execute Python code. While installing Python locally is recommended for more advanced practice, it is not required to start learning; you can use web-based tools for your initial exercises.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Python Interpreter**: A program that reads and executes Python code, similar to translating a recipe into instructions for a computer.
- **Syntax**: Python syntax is designed to be easy to read, mimicking human language.
- **Practice**: Regular practice is crucial for mastering Python, and you'll be encouraged to try coding examples and exercises on your own.

**Example**

```python
friends = ['Taylor','Alex','Pat','Eli']
for friend in friends
    print("Hi " + friend + ", how are you?")
```

The `friend` variable is not something you define separately before the loop. Instead, it’s automatically defined in each iteration of the loop. This is a standard feature of loops in Python (and many other languages).

In the statement for friend in friends:, Python is saying "For each item in the friends list, I will assign it temporarily to the variable friend."
The variable friend is used inside the loop as a placeholder for whatever the current element of the list is during that iteration. It will take on the value of each item in the friends list (e.g., first "Taylor", then "Alex", and so on).
So, to clarify:

friends is the list that holds the data (the names).
friend is a variable that represents each individual item from the list as the loop runs.
Why Is This Natural in Python?
Yes, this is Python’s natural syntax. The variable friend is defined automatically within the context of the loop. You don’t need to declare it separately before the loop; Python creates and assigns it on the fly for each iteration.

In summary:

You define friends as a list, and then Python defines friend automatically during the loop's execution as a temporary variable that holds each individual item of the friends list one by one.
This is how for loops work in Python, and it's a very common and intuitive feature in programming.

### Python resources

- **Learning Python**: To master Python, practice is essential. If Python is installed, you can run the interpreter with `python3` (or `python` on Windows) and exit it with `exit()` or Ctrl-D. If you don’t have it installed, you'll be guided on how to do so in the course.

- **Online Python Practice**: You can also practice Python using online interpreters and codepads. These platforms allow you to execute Python code and see results. Some popular ones include:

### Syntax and codeblocks

- **Syntax**: Correct syntax is crucial when writing code. Even a small mistake like a missing parenthesis or an extra comma can cause a syntax error, preventing the code from executing. Syntax includes the vocabulary, grammar, spelling, and punctuation of the code. 

- **Common Syntax Errors**:
  - Misspellings
  - Incorrect indentations
  - Missing or incorrect characters (e.g., brackets, quotes, colons)
  - Data type mismatches
  - Misuse of reserved words or incorrect case (Python is case-sensitive)

- **Semantic Errors**: Even with correct syntax, the code may behave unexpectedly due to semantic errors. These are related to the meaning or logic of the code. The code may run but produce unintended results due to poor logic or design.

- **Key Takeaways**:
  - Syntax refers to the structure of code, while semantics refers to its meaning and logic.
  - Both types of errors must be considered to ensure the code functions as intended.
  - Always check both syntax and logic when debugging, and run the code to verify the outcome.
  
### Other languages


- **Diversity of Programming Languages**: Python is just one of many programming languages, each with its strengths and weaknesses. Some languages are faster, more suitable for enterprise applications, or excel in specific areas like numerical computing.

- **Platform-Specific Languages**: There are languages like PowerShell (Windows) and Bash (Linux) used for system administration tasks. They are specialized for specific platforms.

- **General-Purpose Languages**: Languages like Perl, Ruby, and JavaScript (initially client-side) are used for scripting and automation. JavaScript is now also used server-side.

- **Traditional Languages**: Other widely used languages include C, C++, Java, and Go, each suited for different kinds of tasks.

- **Learning Multiple Languages**: Once you learn the basics of one programming language, like Python, you can easily transfer those concepts to others. Many languages share common features, such as creating variables, controlling program flow, and handling input/output, albeit with different syntax.

- **Syntax and Semantics Similarities**: Programming languages are like foreign languages, requiring an understanding of syntax and semantics. However, the fundamentals of programming make learning new languages easier, as many share similar concepts.

- **Example of Language Differences**: For example, printing "Hello World" in Python, Bash, and PowerShell uses different commands (e.g., `print`, `echo`, and `Write-Host`), but all achieve the same outcome through similar concepts, such as counting loops.

**Explanation of the Python Syntax**


```python
for i in range(10):
  print("Hello, World!")
```

**Breakdown of the Python syntax:**

1. **`for i in range(10):`**
   - This is a **for loop**, which is used to repeat a block of code multiple times.
   - **`range(10)`** generates a sequence of numbers from 0 to 9 (a total of 10 numbers). So, the loop will run 10 times.
   - The **`i`** is a variable that takes each number in the sequence (0, 1, 2, ..., 9) during each iteration of the loop, but in this case, the value of `i` is not used inside the loop.
   - The **colon (`:`)** after the `for` loop is **essential** in Python, indicating the **start of the block of code that will be executed repeatedly**.

2. **`print("Hello, World!")`**
   - This is the code that will run during each iteration of the loop.
   - **`print()`** is a function in Python that outputs the text inside the parentheses to the console. In this case, it prints `"Hello, World!"`.
   - The indentation (4 spaces) before `print()` is crucial in Python to define the block of code that belongs to the `for` loop. Python relies on indentation, not curly braces `{}` like other languages, to mark blocks of code.

**How Python Syntax Works**

- **Indentation**: In Python, indentation is used to define code blocks. Every statement inside the loop must be indented consistently, otherwise, Python will raise an `IndentationError`. Unlike other programming languages (e.g., C, Java), where code blocks are defined using curly braces `{}`, Python uses indentation to group statements.
  
- **Loops**: The **`for` loop** is a way to iterate over a sequence (like a range of numbers, a list, etc.). Here, **`range(10)`** creates a sequence of numbers from 0 to 9. This allows you to run the block of code inside the loop multiple times.

- **Functions**: **`print()`** is a built-in function in Python used to output text or values to the console. The function call is followed by parentheses containing the argument (the value you want to print).

- **Comments**: If you wanted to add comments to explain parts of the code, you would use the `#` symbol:

```python
# This is a comment, it won't affect the code
```

In Python, you use a **for loop** to repeat a task a specified number of times, often using **`range()`** to define how many iterations to make. Indentation is important in Python, as it determines which code belongs to the loop or condition. Functions like `print()` help display output to the user.

## Hello World!


[[function]] [[keyword]]

In Python, the **"Hello, World!"** program is a simple example used to introduce key programming concepts. When executed, this code displays the words "Hello, World!" on the screen. This example demonstrates:

1. **`print()` function**: A built-in Python function that outputs text to the screen. It is part of Python’s syntax and is used to display data. In the example, `print("Hello, World!")` instructs the computer to print the string "Hello, World!".
   
2. **Keywords**: Reserved words in the programming language used to construct instructions. These are fundamental parts of the syntax and cannot be used for other purposes. Examples include `if`, `while`, and `for`.

3. **Functions**: Blocks of code that perform specific tasks. The `print()` function is an example, as it handles the task of displaying text on the screen.

4. **Strings**: Text in programming is enclosed in quotation marks (`"` or `'`). The text inside the quotes is considered a **string**, which can be manipulated by the program. In this case, `"Hello, World!"` is a string.

5. **Syntax**: The rules governing how code is written. Python’s syntax includes the use of functions like `print()` and proper usage of keywords and strings to construct executable instructions.

The **Hello, World!** example is a traditional first program in many programming languages, providing an introduction to basic syntax, functions, and how a program operates. This program is often the starting point for learning a new language, as it shows how functions are used and what the program's output looks like.

### Getting information from the user



In programming, a useful program needs to **get information from the user** to provide personalized results. This information can be collected in various ways depending on the platform (e.g., websites, mobile apps, command-line programs).

1. **Data Input Methods**:
   - On websites, users may enter text or click links.
   - In mobile apps, data can be input through buttons or drop-down menus.
   - Command-line programs may gather input through parameters or interactive prompts.

2. **Basic Data Handling**:
   - In simple examples, data can be hardcoded directly into the program.
   - Later, more advanced techniques will allow for dynamic data input from various sources (e.g., files, user input).

3. **Personalizing Output**:
   - To personalize the program’s output, you can define variables (e.g., `name = "Brook"`) and use them in functions like `print()`.
   - In the example `print("Hello " + name)`, the program prints "Hello Brook", where the name can easily be changed without altering the structure of the code.

**Key Concepts**:
- **Variable**: A container for storing data, like `name`.
- **String Concatenation**: Joining strings together using the `+` operator, as seen in `"Hello " + name`.
- **Input/Output**: Gathering data and using it in the program (e.g., printing personalized messages).

This approach allows for flexible, user-tailored programs even with simple, hardcoded data.


```python
name = "Brook"
print("Hello " + name)
#Hello Brook
```
```python
name = "Alex"
print("Hello " + name)
#Hello Alex
```
### Python as calculator

[[python]] [[calculator]] [[operations]]

In Python, you can easily perform basic and complex math calculations. Here's a breakdown of key concepts and operations:

1. **Basic Arithmetic**:
   - You can perform simple operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division using standard operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`).
   - Example: `4 + 5 = 9`, `9 * 7 = 63`, `-1 / 4 = -0.25`.

2. **Handling Repeating Decimals**:
   - Some numbers, like `1 / 3`, result in repeating decimals. Python represents them with a finite number of decimal places for practical display.
   
3. **Using Parentheses for Order of Operations**:
   - Parentheses are used to group operations and follow the correct order of calculations, just like in typical math problems.
   - Example: `(2050 / 5 - 32) / 9`.

4. **Exponents and Powers**:
   - Python allows you to calculate powers of numbers using the `**` operator.
   - Example: `2 ** 10` calculates 2 raised to the power of 10.

5. **Why Use Python Over a Calculator?**:
   - While a calculator can handle simple math, Python offers the advantage of automating complex calculations, improving speed and accuracy in tasks like data analysis or system operations (e.g., counting occurrences of words, calculating averages, or determining compression sizes).

**Key Concepts**:
- **Operators**: Symbols like `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `**` that perform mathematical operations.
- **Parentheses**: Used to group operations and define the order of calculations.
- **Exponentiation**: Raising a number to a power using the `**` operator.

Python’s math capabilities are foundational for tasks in fields like data analysis, statistics, and machine learning, although more advanced math operations were not covered in this course.
