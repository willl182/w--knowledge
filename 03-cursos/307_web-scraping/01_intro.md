# Course Introduction

---


**Web Scraping** is the process of extracting data from websites. It involves automatically collecting information from web pages, making it useful for various applications like data analysis, monitoring, and automation. 

**Key Concepts:**
- **Web Scraping**: The practice of retrieving and parsing data from web pages to make it usable for other purposes. It involves navigating a website, identifying elements, and collecting data.
- **Scrapy Framework**: An open-source Python framework designed for web scraping. It provides tools to automate data extraction from websites and handle various scraping tasks efficiently.
  
**Workflow of Web Scraping using Scrapy:**
1. **Sending Requests**: Scrapy sends HTTP requests to websites to fetch data.
2. **Extracting Data**: Using selectors like CSS or XPath, it extracts relevant data from the HTML structure of the page.
3. **Storing Data**: Scrapy allows you to organize and export scraped data in formats like JSON, CSV, or databases.

**Basic Terminology**:
- **Spider**: A Scrapy component that crawls a website and extracts data.
- **Selector**: A tool used to identify and extract elements from the HTML structure using CSS or XPath expressions.

**Workflow**:
1. A Scrapy Spider sends a request to a website.
2. The response (web page data) is processed using selectors.
3. Extracted data is stored or exported for further analysis.

This module introduces the conceptual framework and workflow behind web scraping using Scrapy, laying the foundation for more advanced scraping techniques.

### What Is Web Scraping: Conceptual Overview

**Web Scraping** refers to the automated process of extracting data from websites. It involves using tools or programs to efficiently retrieve specific information from web pages that would otherwise require manual copying. This process is useful for tasks like data analysis, comparison shopping, or gathering large amounts of data from various online sources.

**Key Concept:**
- **Web Scraping**: The automated extraction of data from websites using programs to retrieve specific information quickly and efficiently.

**Why Web Scraping?**
- **Manual Extraction**: Without web scraping, users would need to manually select and copy data, which is time-consuming and inefficient.
- **Automation**: Web scraping automates the process, enabling faster data collection for analysis or other tasks like price comparison.

**Use Cases**:
- Extracting product details (e.g., titles, prices) from e-commerce websites.
- Gathering data for analysis, research, or business intelligence.

In summary, web scraping simplifies and speeds up the process of data extraction from websites, making it a powerful tool for various tasks.


### How Web Scraping Works: Conceptual Overview

Web scraping works by automating the process of extracting specific data from websites through four key steps:

1. **Sending a Request**:  
   The process begins by sending a request to a website using its URL. This is similar to typing a website’s address in a browser to access it. In web scraping, this request is handled programmatically.

2. **Getting the Response**:  
   The website responds with its content, usually in the form of HTML code. This response contains the structure of the website, which includes all visible content like text, images, and buttons.

3. **Selecting the Data**:  
   Once the HTML content is received, we can parse it to locate the specific data we need. This is done using selectors such as **CSS selectors** or **XPath** to target specific elements (e.g., product titles, prices).

4. **Extracting the Data**:  
   After selecting the desired data, the final step is extracting it for further use, such as analysis or storage.

In summary, web scraping involves requesting a website’s content, parsing the HTML response, selecting the relevant data using selectors, and extracting the information for use.
